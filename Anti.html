        "In the entire new testament there is only one person worth respecting:
        Pilate, the Roman governor."
        This is one of Nietzche's more famous works <BR>
          <BR>
        As you can probably tell by now Nietzsche despised Christianity.<BR>
          <BR>
        Nietzsche believed that Christianity made people ashamed of jeaolousy and subservient <br>
        <BR>
        to authority. Nietzsche points out that Christianity was a religion popular among slaves, <br>
        <BR>
        and thus it weakened their ability to sustain themselves and thus they developed a slave morality. <br>
        <br>
        He also argues that Christians denounce what they really want and follow a herd mentality. <br>
        <br>
        Virtues are also viewed as masks for one's own weakness. He argues that submission to one that someone <br>
        <br>
        hates is defined as obedience in Christianity. Not being able to perform revenge becomes forgiveness <br>
        <br>
        Thus he argues that Christianity is a state of denial. <br>
