  <p class="theme">
    Nietzsche fell victim to serious health problems at different points <BR>
        <br>
    in his life. Scholars note he had dysentry, diphtheria, eye sight problems, possibly syphillis, and a number of significant mental health issues. <BR>
        <br>
    There were periods of time where he suffered from blindness and sickness and he was unable to work. <br>
    <BR>
    The physical suffering cause by his health caused him to end his role an as professor. <br>
    <br>

  <p class="theme">
    Nietzsche left the professor position in Basel which gave him a good pension for his work. <BR>
        <br>
    He was able to life off this pension and traveled between Genoa, St. Mortiz, Turin, and Nice. <BR>
        <br>
    These cities had climates that were more conducive to his health. <br>
    <br>
    In 1882 Nietzsche traveled to Rome where he met a woman named Salome who was friends with Nietzsche's sister. <br>
    <BR>
    Nietzsche's sister disaproved of Salome describing her as "an immoral woman." Years later Salome would <br>
    <br>
    join the Germany's Nazi party and Hitler and other high ranking officials attended her funeral. <BR>
    <br>
    Nietzsche fell in love with Salome and asked her to marry him on three seperate occasions but was <br>
    <br>
    denied three times. This caused Nietzsche great mental anguish. He wrote in 1883 after the ordeal <BR>
        <bR>
    that he hates his sister for ruining his chances with Salome. <BR>

    <p class="theme">
        Nietzsche began taking large doses of opium, even writing himself prescriptions for the drug.  <BR>
            <br>
        He claimed that he had trouble sleeping from anxiety due to his romantic loss. <BR>
            <br>
        In the 1880s Nietzsche began writing prolifically and often conflicting with the status quo. <br>
        <BR>
        He was denied a post as a professor at a university due to his athiest views and then later <br>
        <br>
        quit working for an anti semetic publisher. <br>
