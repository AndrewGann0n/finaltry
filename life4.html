    Nietzsche completed his most famous work during this time but also faced public <BR>
        <br>
    backlash from his conflict with Richard Wagner. He criticizes Wagner as a musician <BR>
        <br>
    and for his anti-semetic views. In 1889, Nietzsche suffered a significant mental breakdown<br>
    <BR>
    in the city of Turin, Italy. It is a common tale that Nietzsche saw a horse being flogged <br> 
    <br>
    outside his building, and ran over to the horse and wrapped his armed around its head. <br>
    <br>
    After this event Nietzsche sent crazy writings to his friends and family which caused great alarm. <br>
    <br>
    His sister returned from Nueva Germany in Paraguay to take care of him. <BR>
        <br>
    He suffered from strokes, psychosis, and dementia before passing away on August 25th, 1900 at age 55. <br>
