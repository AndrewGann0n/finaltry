            This is one of Nietzsche's more famous works <BR>
              <BR>
            He makes his famous proclomation "God is Dead!" and he also discusses the ubermensch <BR>
              <BR>
            The "ubermensch" is one of Nietzsche's most prophetic and relevant concepts. <br>
            <BR>
            Nietzsche's main character is man name Zarathustra who comes down from a mountain after thinking about God <br>
            <BR>
            He comes down to the village and says "God does not exist!" <br>
            <br>
            Although Zarathustra denies the existence of God, he warns the villagers <br>
            <br>
            against the dangers of nihilism and becoming "the last man." The last man is <br>
            <br>
            a man who has no purpose and becomes engulfed in consumption and apathy. <br>
        
            </p>

            <p class="theme">
              This work is famous for Nietzche's idea of will to power. <BR>
                <BR>
              This is about man's struggle against his general environment and his desire <BR>
                <BR>
              to overcome obstacles. His character Zarathustra embraces eternity and the enternal <br>
              <BR>
              nature of will to power. There is also the idea of eternal reoccurence. <br>
              <BR>
                Man is in a never ending state of desire and unease. <br>
              </p>
